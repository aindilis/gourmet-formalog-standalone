High sodium content

Condiments and seasonings such as Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, onion salt, garlic salt, and bouillon cubes contain sodium. Processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, and ham, and canned soups and vegetables are all examples of foods that contain added sodium. Fast foods are generally very high in sodium.[8] Also, processed foods such as potato chips, frozen dinners and cured meats have high sodium content. 

Low sodium content

Unprocessed, fresh foods, such as fresh fruits, most vegetables, beef, poultry, fish and unprocessed grains are low in sodium. The availability of low sodium foods is increasing. Low sodium products and low or no sodium labeled versions can be found in stores. Many low sodium products are available online.
