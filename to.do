2020-01-04 19:26:58 <aindilis> is there anything out there for querying a set
      of facts stored in SWIPL mem using SQL sytnax?

(2020-01-06 19:22:22 <sseehh> a substitution and restriction graph would
 resemble route planning. like some vehicles cant travel on certain roads
 some people cant eat certain food but may be able to reach a destination
 (ingredient) through a detour
 )

(get a system going for pengines to provide a client server
 between different formalogs. look at the stuff in ld44 to test)

(use isub to do levenshtein

(possibly use my apt processing tool to process ingredient names down)

(use dcgs to parse the ingredients)


(2020-01-07 19:25:37 <aindilis> hey folks, I am currently using YASWI to
      communicate with SWIPL from Perl.  I run a findall query to grab all
      results, but it usually takes at least a second per query.  I was
      wondering about writing a Pengines client in Perl?  Any particular
      advice regarding this?

2020-01-07 19:27:02 <aindilis> Oh, I should note I already have code for
      parsing Prolog from Perl into an Interlingua e.g. a(b([c,d],E)) would be
      ['a',['b',['_prolog_list','c','d'],\*{'?E'}]]
2020-01-07 19:28:21 <aindilis> Regarding Pengines client in Perl - is there
      anything SWIPL side that would prevent this?  I imagine it's just an
      HTTP-based protocol.
2020-01-07 19:31:33 <aindilis> Another Pengines-based question I have is, I
      have N SWIPL processes, and I want them to be able to query them.
      Currently I'm using SWIPL-(YASWI)->Perl->UniLang->Perl-(YASWI)->SWIPL.
      Does Pengines have a facilitator system for a hub-spoke model or would
      it be better to connect all the pengines to each other, I cannot imagine
      the latter is preferred. 
2020-01-07 19:32:13 <aindilis> And if no facilitator exists, would there be
      interest in me developing one.)
